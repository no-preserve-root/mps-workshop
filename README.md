# mps-workshop
This is the repository for our MPS workshop. Below you can find the different branches and their content.

# branches
The workshop is constructed in a way that each step can be started on a specific branch. This allows everyone to start each step with the same code.
## master
This is the starting point. The language __de.tudo.cs.ls14.aqua.mps.workshop.java__ lets you play with the projectional editor of MPS in the __de.tudo.cs.ls14.aqua.mps.workshop.java.sandbox__ solution. Build the solution, right click on a built __JavaInMPSTest__ model and click `Run Node ...` to execute your code.

## expressions
This branch contains all structure elements necessary for the __Expression__ example. Take this branch to proceed with Editors, or Behavior elements.
